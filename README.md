# Software-Eng-Final-Proj

- We had decided to make an instagram clone
- From past experience, we decided to divide up the tasks depending on strengths and weaknesses of our team members.
- Since Devante had the most experience using xCode and swift, he was primarily in charge of setting up the xCode project. HG has learned how to use gitHub in amny of his classes, so he was in charge of setting up the repository for the code to reside in. Dave has an eye for design so he was in charge of making the decisions regarding the aestetic of the application.
